### Steps to perform Backward Feature Elimination
#### 1. Train the model using all the variables (n)
#### 2. Calculate the performance of the model
#### 3. Eliminate a variable, train the model on remaining variables (n-1)
#### 4. Calculate the performance of the model on new data
#### 5. Identify the eliminated variable which does not impact the performance much
#### 6. Repeat until no more variables can be dropped
