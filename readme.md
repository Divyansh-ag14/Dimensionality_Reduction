### Dimensionality Reduction:
#### Process of reducing the dimensions of the data ensuring it conveys maximum information

### Challenges with high dimensional data:
#### ● Visualization becomes difficult
#### ● All the variables might not be important
#### ● More computation time
#### ● More complex models
#### ● Difficulties in data exploration

### Dimensionality Reduction Techniques

#### 1. Feature Selection: (Missing Value Ratio, Low Variance Filter, High Correlation Filter, Backward Featue Elimination, Forward Feature Selection)
#### 2. Feature Extraction: (Factor Analysis, PCA, t-SNE)
